1. Line 9 will print "values added: 20"
2. Line 13 will print "final result: 20"
3. Var should not be used because result will be function wide variable. If we used let instead of var, the result variable would only be visible in the if block. It can lead to naming conflicts and scoping issues. 
4. Line 9 will print "values added: 20"
5. The function call will return an error because result is not defined outside of the if block.
6. Line 9 returns an error because we declare result as a const and immediately try to assign it to something else. 
7. Similarly to the last question, line 9 returns an error because we declare result as a const and immediately try to assign it to something else. Line 13 will return an error because result is not defined outside of the if statement.
